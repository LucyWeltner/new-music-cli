# New::Music::Cli

This gem uses data from Anthony Fantano's most recent "Track Roundup" video to display recently released songs. The gem can show you all the songs released last week, lets you search the list of songs (by title or by author), and lets you play the songs by opening web pages from the command line.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'new-music-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install new-music-cli

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
